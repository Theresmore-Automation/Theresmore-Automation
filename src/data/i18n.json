The fate of the free and the bloodthirsty hung in the balance, and the outcome was uncertain. But then, a breach was made, and the end seemed near. The humans fought with all their might, knowing that defeat would mean enslavement or worse. The orcish horde stormed forward, a relentless tide of destruction.

The combined forces of humanity and their elven allies stood ready, their hearts steeled by the victories over Baron Mordecai and the Matriarch. Yet, nothing could have prepared them for the sheer malevolence that was the Mindless Evil. As the battle commenced, darkness thicker than any night enveloped the battlefield, swallowing light and hope alike. The Mindless Evil, an amorphous entity of pure chaos and hatred, moved with a terrifying, fluid grace. Its presence warped reality, driving soldiers to madness with its mere proximity. Spells of light and fire seemed to flicker and die in the face of its consuming void. Despite their bravery, the defenders of Theresmore found themselves overwhelmed. The eldritch horrors of the Abyss surged forward, tearing through ranks with unrelenting ferocity. Humanity's greatest champions, alongside their elven allies, fought valiantly but were ultimately powerless against the onslaught. One by one, the brave warriors fell. The luminous beacons that had once illuminated their path flickered and went dark. The screams of the fallen were lost in the all-consuming void. Blood soaked the battlefield, and the cries of the dying echoed through the Abyss, a haunting symphony of despair. In the final moments, as the last remnants of resistance were snuffed out, a chilling silence fell over the battlefield. The Mindless Evil, victorious, spread its influence across Theresmore. The once vibrant lands were plunged into an age of darkness and despair. The great cities crumbled, and nature itself twisted under the weight of the malevolent force. The tales of their valiant struggle became whispered legends, warnings of the hubris that led to their downfall. Hope for a future free from the clutches of the Abyss dimmed, leaving behind only the shadow of what once was. The Mindless Evil, now unchallenged, reveled in its dominion over Theresmore. The surviving inhabitants, few and scattered, lived in constant fear and misery, their spirits broken. The world had been irrevocably changed, and the light of hope had been extinguished, leaving only darkness in its wake",

    "img_annhilator_description": "In a moment of sheer desperation, as the forces of Theresmore teetered on the brink of annihilation, humanity resorted to its most terrifying creation: the Annihilator. This device, forged from the darkest depths of both arcane and technological knowledge, was their final gambit a weapon of unimaginable power, designed to erase the pervasive evil that threatened to engulf their world. When the Annihilator was activated, the heavens themselves seemed to shudder. A cataclysmic explosion of light and energy ripped through the Abyss, tearing apart the shadows that had suffocated the land. For a heartbeat, it appeared that the tides had turned, that salvation was within reach. The darkness shrieked and recoiled, disintegrating under the immense force unleashed. But the victory was a cruel illusion. As the Annihilator’s power reached its zenith, it tore a rift in the very fabric of reality. The ground shook violently, and the sky twisted into unnatural shapes as a gaping black hole began to form at the epicenter of the blast. This void, born from the recklessness of desperation, began to consume everything in its path. Terror spread like wildfire as the black hole expanded, pulling cities, forests, mountains everything into its inescapable maw. The people of Theresmore, once so valiant and determined, could do nothing but watch in horror as their world was devoured. The land was rent asunder, oceans drained into the abyss, and the very air was sucked away, leaving behind only an oppressive silence. In their final moments, as the last remnants of civilization were torn apart, the folly of their actions became painfully clear. The Annihilator, meant to be their deliverance, had instead become their executioner. The unstoppable force they had unleashed now erased all that they had fought to protect. Theresmore was no more. Where once there had been life and light, now there was only a cold, dark void silent, eternal testament to the hubris of those who dared to wield powers beyond their control. The world they had known, the lives they had lived, were lost to the black hole, leaving nothing but an empty expanse of darkness where hope had once flourished",

His draconic servants hurled themselves on the walls with impetuousness but our defenses withstood the impact and gave battle without quarter. The Dragon, annoyed by these insolent humans who had the audacity to stand up to his army, pounced on the walls, mowing down and incinerating anyone who came within range. This was a grave mistake, because so close he was prey to the counterattack of our soldiers who managed to wound him and pierce the delicate membranes of his wings.

Return to the pitiful lands from whence you came, or I shall personally see to it that every single human in the Abyss meets a gruesome end'. With a regal wave of his hand, Mordecai's legions, dark and formidable, began their relentless march toward the human outpost.

Beside him, Vaelgoroth, the Crimson Doom, unfurled its massive wings, casting shadows over the battlefield. Its obsidian scales gleamed with an eerie fire, and its breath was the furnace of death itself.Once, Vaelgoroth had unleashed destruction upon Theresmore, laying waste to its lands and cities in an inferno of rage. But it had been defeated—driven back into the depths of the world. Now, it had been resurrected, its power amplified by Azrathis’s twisted magic, and it was far more terrible than before.
